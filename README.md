2.Machine learning concepts and
applications,Overview of
Supervised, Unsupervised, and
Reinforcement learning.

3.Data Preprocessing for
Machine Learning

4.Python Library: Numpy, Pandas, Sklearn

5.Supervised Learning :Classification
Understanding classification
analysis and its use in machine
learning,
Building logistic regression,
Support Vector Machines,
Random Forest, K-Nearest
Neighbor, Na√Øve Bayes and
Decision tree models.

6. Unsupervised Learning :
Clustering
Understanding clustering analysis
and its use in machine learning,
Building k-means and hierarchical
clustering models,Evaluating
model performance and making
predictions

7. Unsupervised Learning -
Dimensionality Reduction
Understanding dimensionality
reduction and its use in machine
learning,Building principal
component analysis (PCA) and
t-SNE models,Evaluating model
performance and making
predictions.

8. Natural Language
